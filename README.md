# Blender On Google Colab

This is a Google Colab Python Notebook which can be used to render blender files with a GPU in the cloud, based on [donmahallem's repo](https://github.com/donmahallem/colab_blender) with some changes.
Run this directly as is on Google Colab by clicking the following button:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yassir-a-p/blender-on-colab/blob/master/blender-on-colab.ipynb)


## Instructions

First of all: You will need to own a Google Account!

Once you are logged in you either upload the script found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yassir-a-p/blender-on-colab/blob/master/blender-on-colab.ipynb) to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or just use the `Open in colab` Badge above.

Now you will need to upload your `.blend` file and all needed separate assets to Google Drive (either via the web GUI or desktop application).

Once done open the `blender-on-colab.ipynb` in Colab and insert your `.blend` files name and path into the specified script fields and run the script.

You will be prompted to authorize that Colab will need access to your Google Drive.

## Other runtimes

This script is not exclusive to Google Colab but might need minor modifications to be able to run.

### Appendix

This script/repository isn't associated with Google Colab or Google in any way!

I keep this separate and not a fork because this is my own take as I moved things around and the changes were initially only for my own use. Some changes may later be submitted as pull requests to donmahallem's repo.
